This website is **YaeeunKANG's BLOG**.
I'll post my coding diary here.

I'm a student at Soonchunhyang University.
My major is Medical Mechatronics Engineering, and double major is Computer Software Engineering.
This year, I'm in a school club, **LikeLion 8th**, which is a coding club.

Now, I'm studying about **Python**, **Django**, **HTML/CSS**.
